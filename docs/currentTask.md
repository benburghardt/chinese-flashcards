# Current Task: Phase 1 - Task 1.9 SRS Study Session (In Progress)

## Status: Partially Complete - Debugging Required

### Completed:
- ✅ Created SpacedRepetition component with full SRS session logic
- ✅ Implemented two-question system (definition + pinyin)
- ✅ Added answer verification with keyword matching
- ✅ Implemented card cycling for incorrect answers
- ✅ Created session progress tracking
- ✅ Built session completion screen
- ✅ Added CSS styling for all SRS components
- ✅ Integrated with App.tsx
- ✅ Created utility command to introduce multiple characters for testing
- ✅ Fixed feedback display (only shows full info when incorrect)
- ✅ Fixed question type selection (won't ask same question twice)

### Issues to Debug (Next Session):
1. **App restarting when both questions answered correctly**
   - Symptom: After answering both definition and pinyin correctly, the app seems to restart/reload
   - Does NOT happen on incorrect answers (working correctly)
   - Need to check browser console logs to identify root cause

2. **Possible root causes to investigate:**
   - Backend `submit_srs_answer` call might be causing state issues
   - Character unlock flow might be triggering unexpected behavior
   - Session state management might have edge case bugs

### Code Changes Made:
- Updated `SessionCard` interface to track `answeredDefinition`, `answeredPinyin`, and `fullyAnswered`
- Modified `handleSubmit` to only update local state (not backend)
- Rewrote `handleNext` to handle two-question logic and backend submission
- Added `selectNextQuestionType` to intelligently pick unanswered question types
- Modified feedback section to only show card details when incorrect
- Added `unlockedCharacters` state to defer showing introduction screen until session complete
- Updated session complete screen to handle unlocked characters

### Next Steps:
1. Debug app restart issue with browser console open
2. Check if issue is in frontend (SpacedRepetition.tsx) or backend (submit_srs_answer)
3. Possibly add error boundaries or better error handling
4. Test complete flow: session → unlock character → introduction → return to dashboard
5. Move to Task 1.10 once debugging is complete

### Testing Notes:
- Use "⚡ Introduce 10 Characters" button to set up test cards
- Use "📚 Start SRS Session" to test the flow
- Open browser console (F12) to see any errors or warnings
- Test both correct and incorrect answer paths
- Verify card cycling works for incorrect answers
- Verify both questions must be answered correctly before moving to next card
