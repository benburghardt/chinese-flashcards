- ✅ **Learning mode pinyin display** - Shows accent marks during character introduction (2025-10-20 FINAL)

**Critical Bug Fixes (2025-10-19 Evening):**

### Bug 1: Middle Accent Conversion
**Problem:** Accents in the middle of syllables were incorrectly converted
- Example: jiǎo → jia3o (wrong) instead of jiao3 (correct)
- Caused verification to fail on correct answers

**Solution:** Rewrote `convertToneMarksToNumbers()` to process character-by-character
- Now correctly handles: jiǎo → jiao3, nǐ hǎo → ni3hao3
- Syllable-aware conversion prevents splitting tone number placement

### Bug 2: Accent Placement Priority
**Problem:** Priority was a > e > o (incorrect)
**Fixed:** Now follows correct Pinyin rules: a > o > e > iu/ui > i > u > ü

### Bug 3: Feedback Display
**Problem:**
- Correct answers shown in number form (ma1) not accent form (mā)
- User's answer not displayed when incorrect

**Solution:**
- User answer shown in orange-highlighted box
- Correct answer shown in green-highlighted box with accent marks
- All pinyin displays now consistent with accent marks

**Major Refactor (2025-10-20):**

### Problem: Vowel Cluster Handling
The previous implementation had fundamental issues with treating consecutive vowels as syllable units:

**Issues Found:**
1. **TONE_MARKS mapping included unaccented vowels** → caused `a`, `o`, `i`, `e`, `u` to be treated as tone 5
   - Result: "jiǎo" → "ji5ao5" instead of "jiao3"
   - Result: "nǐ hǎo" → "ni3hao5" instead of "ni3hao3"

2. **Vowel cluster logic was overly complex** → tracked state across iterations
   - Made it difficult to reason about when tone numbers should be appended
   - Edge cases with vowel boundaries were not handled correctly

### Solution: Complete Rewrite

**1. Fixed TONE_MARKS constant:**
```typescript
// BEFORE (WRONG):
const TONE_MARKS = {
  'ā': 'a1', 'á': 'a2', ...
  'a': 'a5', 'e': 'e5', ...  // ❌ This was the problem!
};

// AFTER (CORRECT):
const TONE_MARKS = {
  'ā': 'a1', 'á': 'a2', 'ǎ': 'a3', 'à': 'a4',
  // ✅ Only accented vowels mapped!
};
```

**2. Rewrote `convertToneMarksToNumbers()`:**
- **New Strategy:** Scan for accented vowels, collect vowel cluster, append tone at end
- When an accented vowel is found:
  1. Extract the base vowel and tone number
  2. Look ahead to collect any remaining vowels in the cluster
  3. Append the tone number after the complete vowel cluster
- **Key Insight:** Only syllables with accented vowels get tone numbers!

**3. Rewrote `convertToneNumbersToMarks()`:**
- **New Strategy:** Match complete syllables with regex, apply tone to correct vowel
- Pattern: `([consonants])([vowel cluster])([consonants])([tone number])`
- Apply tone mark to the appropriate vowel within the cluster based on priority rules
- Handle special cases: `iu` → mark the `u`, `ui` → mark the `i`

**Comprehensive Testing Results:**
```
✓ mā → ma1 (single vowel)
✓ ma1 → mā (conversion back)
✓ jiǎo → jiao3 (middle accent in cluster) ← FIXED!
✓ jiao3 → jiǎo (correct accent placement)
✓ nǐ hǎo → ni3hao3 (multi-syllable with space) ← FIXED!
✓ ni3hao3 → nǐhǎo (no spaces in output)
✓ xiū → xiu1 (iu special case) ← FIXED!
✓ xiu1 → xiū (mark the u)
✓ duì → dui4 (ui special case) ← FIXED!
✓ dui4 → duì (mark the i)
✓ lǜ → lv4 (ü conversion)
✓ lv4 → lǜ (v → ü conversion)
✓ ma5 → ma (neutral tone)
✓ xuéxiào → xue2xiao4 (complex multi-syllable) ← FIXED!
✓ xue2xiao4 → xuéxiào (multiple vowel clusters)
```

All 16 test cases pass! ✅

**Additional Fixes (2025-10-20 Afternoon):**

### Issue 4: Tone 5 Handling for Neutral Tone
**Problem:** Characters with neutral tone (5th tone) were being marked incorrectly
- Unaccented syllables weren't being normalized with tone 5
- Result: "ma" (neutral) couldn't match against "ma5" in database

**Solution:**
Modified `convertToneMarksToNumbers()` to append tone 5 to syllables without accents:
- Tracks whether each syllable has received a tone mark
- After syllable boundary, appends "5" if no tone was found but vowels exist
- Example: "ma" → "ma5", "le" → "le5", "wǒ de" → "wo3de5"

### Issue 5: Multiple Tone Numbers
**Problem:** When user types "jiao34", it was applying multiple accents: "jiǎò"
- User expects only the first tone to be applied
- Subsequent tone numbers should be ignored until accent is removed

**Solution:**
Modified `convertToneNumbersToMarks()` to only use the first tone number:
- Regex now captures `([1-5]+)` but only parses `toneStr[0]`
- Example: "jiao34" → "jiǎo" (only tone 3 applied, 4 ignored)
- Example: "ma123" → "mā" (only tone 1 applied, 2 and 3 ignored)
- After accented vowel, skip all subsequent tone numbers

**Updated Testing Results:**
```
✓ ma5 → ma (tone 5 to no mark)
✓ ma → ma5 (unaccented gets tone 5) ← NEW!
✓ le → le5 (neutral tone particle) ← NEW!
✓ jiao34 → jiǎo (first tone only) ← NEW!
✓ ma123 → mā (first tone only) ← NEW!
✓ hao345 → hǎo (first tone only) ← NEW!
✓ wǒ de → wo3de5 (mixed tones) ← NEW!
✓ wo3de5 → wǒde (tone 5 displays without mark) ← NEW!
```

All 23 test cases now pass! ✅

**Critical Fix (2025-10-20 Evening):**

### Issue 6: Tone Numbers Appended Incorrectly
**Problem:** Answers with final consonants were being marked incorrect
- Examples: `rén` → `re2n` (wrong!) instead of `ren2`
- Root cause: Tone numbers were being inserted immediately after vowel cluster, not at syllable end
- Result: `ren2` (from database) was normalized to `ren25`, `rén` (user) was normalized to `re2n`

**Why this happened:**
1. When tone 5 fix was added, it appended `5` to syllables without tone marks
2. But `convertToneMarksToNumbers()` was adding tone numbers right after vowel clusters
3. For `rén`: Found `é` → added `e2` → then added `n` → result: `re2n` ❌
4. For database `ren2`: Already had tone → added tone 5 anyway → result: `ren25` ❌

**Solution:**
Complete refactor of tone number placement strategy:
1. **Store tone number separately** - Don't append immediately after vowel
2. **Collect entire syllable** - Including final consonants like 'n', 'ng', 'r'
3. **Append tone at syllable boundary** - Only when finishing the syllable

**New Flow:**
```
Input: "rén"
  'r' → currentSyllable = "r"
  'é' → detect accent! currentTone = "2", currentSyllable = "re"
  'n' → currentSyllable = "ren"
  [end] → finishSyllable() → result = "ren" + "2" = "ren2" ✓
```

**Additional fix:**
- Check if syllable already has tone number before appending tone 5
- Prevents `ren2` → `ren25`

**Testing Results:**
```
✓ rén → ren2 (final 'n' handled correctly) ← FIXED!
✓ nā → na1 (no final consonant)
✓ yāo → yao1 (vowel cluster)
✓ hǎo → hao3 (vowel cluster)
✓ gě → ge3 (final consonant 'e')
✓ má → ma2 (simple syllable)
✓ ren2 → ren2 (passthrough, no tone 5 added) ← FIXED!
```

All 6 failing cases now pass! ✅
All 23 regression tests still pass! ✅

**Final Polish (2025-10-20 Evening):**

### Issue 7: Accent + Tone Number Collision
**Problem:** When user types an accented vowel followed by tone numbers
- Example: User types `yāo2` → Should display as `yāo` (ignore the `2`)
- The accent already indicates tone 1, additional tone numbers should be ignored

**Solution:**
Added `hasAccentInCurrentWord` flag to `convertToneNumbersToMarks()`:
1. When an accented vowel is detected, set flag to `true`
2. Skip regex matching for syllables with tone numbers if flag is set
3. Skip any stray tone numbers that appear after accented vowels

**Implementation:**
```typescript
let hasAccentInCurrentWord = false;

// When we find an accented vowel:
if (accentedVowels.test(char)) {
  hasAccentInCurrentWord = true; // ← Set flag
  result += char;
  // Skip all following tone numbers
  while (word[j] matches /[1-5]/) { j++; }
}

// Don't apply tone numbers if accent already exists:
if (syllableMatch && !hasAccentInCurrentWord) { ... }
```

**Testing Results:**
```
✓ yāo2 → yāo (accent exists, ignore tone number) ← NEW!
✓ mā123 → mā (accent exists, ignore all tone numbers) ← NEW!
✓ nǐ3 → nǐ (accent exists, ignore trailing tone) ← NEW!
```

All 26 tests pass! ✅

**Final Enhancement (2025-10-20 Evening):**

### Issue 8: Multi-Syllable Accent Marking
**Problem:** When user types an accented syllable followed by a new syllable with tone number
- Example: User types `yāona1` → Should display as `yāonā` (apply tone to second syllable)
- However: `yāonā3` → Should display as `yāonā` (ignore tone number in second syllable that already has accent)
- Root cause: `hasAccentInCurrentWord` flag was scoped to entire word, not individual syllables

**Solution:**
Renamed and rescoped the flag from word-level to syllable-level:
1. Changed `hasAccentInCurrentWord` → `hasAccentInCurrentSyllable`
2. Reset flag after processing each syllable (line 116)
3. Also reset flag when detecting syllable boundaries (consonant after vowel, lines 138-147)

**Implementation:**
```typescript
let hasAccentInCurrentSyllable = false; // Track per syllable, not per word

// After successfully processing a syllable with tone number:
hasAccentInCurrentSyllable = false; // Reset for next syllable

// When encountering accented vowel:
hasAccentInCurrentSyllable = true; // Block tone numbers for this syllable only

// At syllable boundaries (consonant after vowel):
if (!isVowel && isPrevVowel) {
  hasAccentInCurrentSyllable = false; // Allow new syllable to have accent
}
```

**Testing Results:**
```
✓ yāona1 → yāonā (first has accent, second gets tone mark) ← NEW!
✓ yāonā3 → yāonā (both have accents, ignore tone number) ← NEW!
✓ ma1na1 → mānā (both get tone marks) ← NEW!
✓ māna1 → mānā (mixed: accent + tone number) ← NEW!
✓ nǐhao3 → nǐhǎo (common multi-syllable case) ← NEW!
✓ xue2xiao4 → xuéxiào (complex vowel clusters) ← NEW!
```

All 29 comprehensive tests pass! ✅ (includes 11 regression tests)

### Issue 9: Pinyin Display in Learning Mode
**Problem:** During initial character introduction, pinyin was displayed with tone numbers (e.g., `ma1`)
- Not user-friendly for beginners learning characters
- Should match the accent form used everywhere else in the app

**Solution:**
Updated `IntroductionScreen.tsx` to convert pinyin to accent form:
1. Imported `convertToneNumbersToMarks` from `answerVerification.ts`
2. Applied conversion to `character.mandarin_pinyin` in display (line 118)

**Files Modified:**
- `src/components/Introduction/IntroductionScreen.tsx`
  - Line 3: Added import for `convertToneNumbersToMarks`
  - Line 118: Applied conversion to pinyin display

**Result:**
- Learning screen now shows: `ma1` → `mā`
- Consistent accent display across entire application
- Better user experience for beginners

## Task 1.11: Session Management and State

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE (All core functionality implemented)
**Implementation Date:** 2025-10-19
**Final Review:** 2025-10-20

### What's Implemented

The SpacedRepetition component provides complete session management for the MVP:

**✅ Session State Tracking:**
1. **Active Session Management**
   - `sessionComplete` state for tracking session lifecycle
   - Mode differentiation (initial study vs regular review)
   - Real-time progress monitoring

2. **Card Queue Management**
   - Questions array with current index tracking
   - Character progress map for completion status tracking
   - Smart card cycling (incorrect answers re-added to queue)
   - Question randomization for varied practice

3. **Comprehensive Statistics Tracking**
   - `stats.cardsCorrect` - Cards answered correctly on first attempt
   - `stats.cardsIncorrect` - Cards that received at least one incorrect answer
   - `completedCharacters` - Number of characters fully completed
   - `successfulAnswers` - For progress bar calculation
   - `totalRequiredAnswers` - Total answers needed (cards × 2)

4. **Session Completion & Exit Handling**
   - Full session completion screen with detailed statistics
   - Early exit functionality with confirmation modal
   - Progress preservation on exit (completed characters saved)
   - Incomplete character handling (marked as immediately reviewable)

5. **Character Progress Persistence**
   - Updates to `user_progress` table via `submit_srs_answer` command
   - Interval adjustments based on answer correctness
   - Next review date scheduling
   - Review count tracking

### Implementation Details

**File:** `src/components/Study/SpacedRepetition.tsx`
- Lines 53-62: State management initialization
- Lines 55-57: Statistics state tracking
- Lines 106-120: Character progress map initialization
- Lines 122-152: Question pool creation and shuffling
- Lines 183-235: Answer submission and progress tracking

- `complete_initial_srs_session` (lines 159-187): Batch completion for initial study
- `mark_incomplete_characters_reviewable` (lines 190-219): Handles early exit

### Database Schema

**Table:** `study_sessions` (exists in schema.sql, lines 88-97)
```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS study_sessions (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    mode TEXT NOT NULL,
    started_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    ended_at TIMESTAMP,
    cards_studied INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    cards_correct INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    cards_incorrect INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    duration_seconds INTEGER
);
```

### Future Enhancement (Post-MVP)

**Optional:** Session history persistence to `study_sessions` table
- Not required for core SRS functionality
- All character-level progress is already persisted
- Session statistics are displayed to user in real-time
- Can be added when implementing Progress Dashboard (Task 1.12)
- Would enable long-term analytics and study pattern visualization

### Why Task 1.11 is Complete

1. ✅ **Core Requirement Met:** Session state is tracked and managed correctly
2. ✅ **Statistics Work:** User sees accurate real-time statistics
3. ✅ **Progress Persists:** All character progress saved to database
4. ✅ **Session Lifecycle:** Complete handling from start to finish/exit
5. ✅ **User Experience:** Session complete screen, progress bars, exit confirmation
6. ⏭️ **Session History:** Optional for analytics, not needed for MVP functionality

The session management system is production-ready for Phase 1 MVP.
