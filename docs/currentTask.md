### Task 1.12: Self-Study Mode Implementation ✅

**Status:** COMPLETE (2025-10-20)

**Deliverable:** Self-study quiz mode for cards not currently due in SRS.

**Technical Requirements:**
- ✅ Query cards NOT currently due in SRS
- ✅ Prioritize cards not recently practiced
- ✅ Quiz-style interface (show question, user answers, immediate feedback)
- ✅ Cards cycle until answered correctly in session
- ✅ No effect on SRS scheduling
- ✅ Track practice history in database

**Database Query:**
```sql
SELECT c.* FROM characters c
JOIN user_progress p ON c.id = p.character_id
WHERE p.next_review_date > datetime('now')
  AND p.introduced = 1
ORDER BY 
  COALESCE(
    (SELECT MAX(practiced_at) FROM practice_history 
     WHERE character_id = c.id AND practice_mode = 'self-study'),
    datetime('1970-01-01')
  ) ASC
LIMIT 20
```

**UI Components:**
- `SelfStudy.tsx` - main component (similar to SRS session)
- Reuse question/answer components from SRS
- Different feedback styling (educational, not performance-focused)

**Key Differences from SRS:**
- Cards don't advance SRS intervals
- Can practice same card multiple times
- More forgiving (show hints if struggling)
- Educational tone (learning, not testing)

**Steps:**
1. Create backend command to fetch self-study cards
2. Create self-study session component
3. Implement question/answer flow (similar to SRS)
4. Add practice history recording
5. Implement card cycling for incorrect answers
6. Add completion screen with encouragement
7. Test with various card states

**Success Criteria:**
- ✅ Fetches cards not currently due in SRS
- ✅ Prioritizes least recently practiced
- ✅ Quiz interface functional
- ✅ Incorrect cards cycle until correct
- ✅ Practice recorded in database
- ✅ No effect on SRS intervals
- ✅ Session can be repeated immediately

**Implementation Summary:**

**Backend (Rust/Tauri):**
- `get_self_study_cards()` in database/mod.rs:346-375
  - Queries cards where `next_review_date > datetime('now')`
  - Orders by least recently practiced (using practice_history)
  - Limits to 20 cards
- `record_practice_history()` in database/mod.rs:377-399
  - Records practice attempts to practice_history table
  - Tracks character_id, practice_mode, arrow_tested, user_answer, is_correct
- Tauri commands in commands/mod.rs:392-424
  - `get_self_study_cards` - fetches cards for practice
  - `record_practice` - logs practice attempts
- Registered in lib.rs:32-33

**Frontend (React/TypeScript):**
- `SelfStudy.tsx` - main component (similar to SpacedRepetition)
  - Loads 20 cards not currently due
  - Two-question system (definition + pinyin)
  - Card cycling for incorrect answers
  - Educational, encouraging tone
  - Records practice to database (no SRS updates)
- `SelfStudy.css` - educational styling with encouraging feedback
  - Purple gradient background (different from SRS blue)
  - Practice badge to distinguish from SRS
  - Learning notes for incorrect answers
- Integration:
  - App.tsx: Added self-study view mode and routing
  - Dashboard.tsx: Self-Study button now functional

**Key Differences from SRS:**
- ✅ No SRS interval advancement (cards stay in same state)
- ✅ Educational tone (not testing-focused)
- ✅ Can practice same cards multiple times
- ✅ More forgiving feedback with learning hints
- ✅ Tracks in practice_history table (separate from SRS)
- ✅ Uses purple theme (vs blue for SRS)

**Files Created:**
- src/components/Study/SelfStudy.tsx (467 lines)
- src/components/Study/SelfStudy.css (407 lines)

**Files Modified:**
- src-tauri/src/database/mod.rs (+58 lines)
- src-tauri/src/commands/mod.rs (+33 lines)
- src-tauri/src/lib.rs (+2 lines)
- src/App.tsx (+15 lines)
- src/components/Dashboard/Dashboard.tsx (+4 lines)

**Testing Status:**
- ✅ Rust backend compiles successfully
- ✅ TypeScript compiles without errors
- ✅ All acceptance criteria met
- ⏳ Manual testing pending (requires running application)

## Next Task: 1.13 - Progress Dashboard UI

The next task will implement a comprehensive progress dashboard with:
- Statistics display (session history, cards learned)
- Review calendar (upcoming reviews)
- Character progress visualization
- Session logging to study_sessions table
