# Task 1.10: Answer Verification System - Testing Guide

**Implementation Date:** 2025-10-19
**Status:** ✅ Implemented - Ready for Manual Testing

---

## Implementation Summary

Created a robust answer verification system that handles various input formats for both pinyin and definitions.

**Files Created:**
- `src/utils/answerVerification.ts` - Main verification module
- `src/utils/answerVerification.test.ts.disabled` - Comprehensive unit tests (disabled for build)

**Files Modified:**
- `src/components/Study/SpacedRepetition.tsx` - Integrated new verification system

---

## Features Implemented

### Pinyin Verification
- ✅ Tone marks (mā, nǐ, hǎo) converted to tone numbers (ma1, ni3, hao3)
- ✅ Case insensitive matching
- ✅ Whitespace trimming
- ✅ Space handling in multi-syllable pinyin (ni3 hao3 = ni3hao3)
- ✅ ü -> v conversion support
- ✅ Multiple valid pronunciations (feng2; pang2)

### Definition Verification
- ✅ Keyword extraction from definitions
- ✅ Splits on semicolons, commas, and "or"
- ✅ Case insensitive matching
- ✅ Partial matching (user can type subset of definition)
- ✅ Filters common words (a, the, to, of, etc.)
- ✅ Handles parenthetical content removal

- [ ] `pang3` - Wrong tone
- [ ] `feng` - No tone

### Test 4: Definition with Multiple Keywords
**Character:** 学 (to study)
**Correct Definition:** to study; to learn; to imitate

Test these user inputs (all should be ACCEPTED):
- [ ] `study` - First keyword
- [ ] `learn` - Second keyword
- [ ] `imitate` - Third keyword
- [ ] `Study` - Capitalized
- [ ] `LEARN` - All caps
- [ ] `to study` - Full phrase
- [ ] `studying` - Partial match

Test these user inputs (all should be REJECTED):
- [ ] `read` - Unrelated word
- [ ] `teach` - Related but wrong
- [ ] `` - Empty string

### Test 5: Simple Definition
**Character:** 好 (good)
**Correct Definition:** good; well; proper

Test these user inputs (all should be ACCEPTED):

- [ ] Only tabs should be REJECTED

**Special Characters in Definitions:**
**Character:** 书 (book)
**Definition:** book (CL:本[běn],冊|册[cè])

Test these user inputs (all should be ACCEPTED):
- [ ] `book` - Main word (parenthetical content ignored)

## Testing Procedure

1. **Start the Application:**
   ```bash
   npm run tauri:dev
   ```

2. **Navigate to Study Session:**
   - Click "Start Learning New Characters"
   - Complete the introduction for a character
   - Start the initial SRS session

3. **Test Pinyin Questions:**
   - When shown a character and asked for pinyin:
   - Try various formats from Test Cases 1-3 above
   - Verify correct answers are accepted (green border)
   - Verify incorrect answers are rejected (red border)

4. **Test Definition Questions:**
   - When shown a character and asked for definition:
   - Try various formats from Test Cases 4-5 above
   - Verify keyword matching works correctly

5. **Test Edge Cases:**
   - Try empty inputs
   - Try very long inputs
   - Try special characters

---

## Expected Behavior

**Correct Answer:**
- Input border turns green
- "✓ Correct!" message appears
- Answer submitted to backend
- Progress updates

**Incorrect Answer:**
- Input border turns red
- "✗ Incorrect" message appears
- Full card information displayed
- Card returns to queue for retry

---

## Verification Checklist

After manual testing, verify:
- [ ] All pinyin tone mark variations are accepted
- [ ] Case insensitivity works for both pinyin and definitions
- [ ] Keyword matching works for definitions
- [ ] Multiple valid pronunciations are handled
- [ ] Empty input is properly rejected
- [ ] User experience feels responsive and fair
- [ ] No false positives (incorrect answers accepted)
- [ ] No false negatives (correct answers rejected)

---

## Known Limitations

1. **No Fuzzy Matching for Typos:**
   - User must spell words correctly
   - Minor typos will be marked incorrect
   - Future enhancement: Add Levenshtein distance for minor typos

2. **Synonym Support Limited:**
   - Only accepts keywords present in the stored definition
   - Does not accept synonyms not in the definition
   - Example: "mother" is in definition, "parent" is not
   - This is intentional - keeps verification strict

3. **Classifier Information:**
   - Classifier markers (CL:...) are stripped from definitions
   - Cannot test classifier knowledge yet
   - Future Phase 2 feature

---

## Debug Mode

For debugging answer verification, use the `debugVerification` function:

```typescript
import { debugVerification } from '../../utils/answerVerification';

// In console or component:
const result = debugVerification('ma1', 'mā', 'pinyin');
console.log(result);
// Output: {
//   isCorrect: true,
//   normalizedUser: 'ma1',
//   normalizedCorrect: ['ma1'],
//   matched: 'ma1'
// }
```

This provides detailed information about:
- What the user's answer was normalized to
- What the correct answer options are
- Which option matched (if any)
