**Date:** 2025-10-18
**Status:** ✅ Complete

### Implementation

Created database module and build process to generate production SQLite database from parsed data.

- `data-processing/schema.sql` - Schema copy for data processing

**Files Modified:**
- `data-processing/src/bin/build_database.rs` - Complete build workflow
- `data-processing/src/lib.rs` - Exposed database module

**Key Functions:**
```rust
pub fn create_database(path: &str) -> Result<Connection>
pub fn insert_characters(conn: &Connection, entries: &[EnrichedEntry]) -> Result<()>
pub fn initialize_user_progress(conn: &Connection, count: usize) -> Result<()>
pub fn verify_database(conn: &Connection) -> Result<()>
```

**Key Features:**
- Transaction-based insertion for atomicity
- INSERT OR IGNORE for duplicate handling (keeps first occurrence)
- Frequency-based initialization (first 15 characters ready to learn)
- Progress reporting every 10,000 entries
- Comprehensive verification output

**Database Statistics:**
- 120,273 total unique entries
  - 11,008 individual characters
  - 109,265 words
- 15 initial characters in user_progress (ready to learn)
- 27MB database file size

- Foreign keys properly configured

**Build Process:**
1. Parse CC-CEDICT and SUBTLEX-CH data
2. Create SQLite database with schema

**Files Modified:**
- `src-tauri/src/lib.rs` - Initialize database, register commands
- `src-tauri/src/commands/mod.rs` - Tauri command handlers
- `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json` - Resource bundle configuration
- `src-tauri/build.rs` - Copy database to resources
- `src-tauri/Cargo.toml` - Added rusqlite dependency

**Database Module Functions:**
```rust
pub fn init_database(app_handle: &AppHandle) -> Result<Connection>
pub fn get_character_by_id(conn: &Connection, id: i32) -> Result<Character>
pub fn get_characters_by_frequency(conn: &Connection, limit: usize) -> Result<Vec<Character>>

- `get_top_characters` - Get top N characters by frequency

**Key Decisions:**
- Database connection managed via Tauri State with Mutex
- Database file embedded in app bundle as resource
- All queries wrapped in safe Rust functions
- Tauri commands provide clean frontend API

**Database Location:**

## Task 1.6: Implement SRS Algorithm (Rust)

**Date:** 2025-10-18
**Status:** ✅ Complete

### Implementation

Implemented a modified SM-2 spaced repetition algorithm with custom interval progression.

**Files Created:**
- `src-tauri/src/srs/mod.rs` (219 lines) - Complete SRS algorithm

**Files Modified:**
- `src-tauri/Cargo.toml` - Added chrono dependency
- `src-tauri/src/lib.rs` - Added srs module

**Data Structures:**
```rust
pub struct SrsCard {
    pub character_id: i32,
    pub current_interval_days: f32,
    pub previous_interval_days: f32,
    pub ease_factor: f32,
    pub times_correct: i32,
    pub times_incorrect: i32,
    pub has_reached_week: bool,
}

pub struct SrsUpdate {
    pub new_interval_days: f32,
    pub new_ease_factor: f32,
    pub next_review_date: DateTime<Utc>,
    pub reached_week_for_first_time: bool,
}
```

**Key Functions:**
```rust
pub fn calculate_next_review(card: &SrsCard, correct: bool) -> SrsUpdate
fn calculate_interval_correct(card: &SrsCard) -> (f32, f32)
fn calculate_interval_incorrect(card: &SrsCard) -> (f32, f32)
```

**Algorithm Details:**

**Correct Answer Progression:**
- 1 hour → 12 hours → 1 day → 3 days → 7 days → exponential
- After 7 days: `new_interval = current_interval * ease_factor`
- Ease factor unchanged on correct answers

**Incorrect Answer Handling:**
- Return to previous interval
- Minimum interval: 1 hour (user-friendly, not 1 day)
- Ease factor decreases by 0.2 (minimum 1.3)

**Key Decisions:**
- Modified SM-2 with custom early intervals (more user-friendly)
- 1 hour minimum on incorrect (not harsh 1-day reset)
- Uses `chrono` crate for precise DateTime handling
- Tracks "reached week" milestone for unlock system

**Testing:**
- ✅ Unit tests for interval calculations
- ✅ Manual testing with database integration

---

## Task 1.7: User Progress Tracking Commands

**Date:** 2025-10-18
**Status:** ✅ Complete

### Implementation

Implemented comprehensive set of Tauri commands for SRS operations and character unlock system.

**Files Modified:**
- `src-tauri/src/commands/mod.rs` - Added all SRS commands
- `src-tauri/src/database/mod.rs` - Added query functions

**Tauri Commands Implemented:**

```rust
#[tauri::command]
pub fn get_due_cards_for_review(db: State<DbConnection>) -> Result<Vec<DueCard>, String>

#[tauri::command]
pub fn submit_srs_answer(db: State<DbConnection>, character_id: i32, correct: bool) -> Result<bool, String>

#[tauri::command]
pub fn unlock_new_character(db: State<DbConnection>) -> Result<Option<Character>, String>

#[tauri::command]
pub fn introduce_character(db: State<DbConnection>, character_id: i32) -> Result<(), String>

#[tauri::command]
pub fn introduce_character_immediately_reviewable(db: State<DbConnection>, character_id: i32) -> Result<(), String>

#[tauri::command]
pub fn get_unlocked_characters_batch(db: State<DbConnection>, batch_size: usize) -> Result<Vec<Character>, String>

#[tauri::command]
pub fn mark_all_ready_characters_introduced(db: State<DbConnection>) -> Result<String, String>

#[tauri::command]
pub fn introduce_multiple_characters(db: State<DbConnection>, character_ids: Vec<i32>) -> Result<(), String>
```

**Unlock System Logic:**

1. **Initial State:**
   - First 15 characters start unlocked (ready to learn)
   - User introduces these characters

2. **Unlock Timer:**
   - After introduction, timer starts when ANY character reaches 1-week interval
   - Timer duration: 2 days
   - Prevents overwhelming users with too many new characters

3. **Batch Unlock:**
   - After timer expires, next batch of characters unlocks
   - Batch size configurable (default: 10)
   - Characters unlocked by frequency rank

**Key Decisions:**
- 2-day timer between batches (balances learning pace)
- Timer triggered by first character reaching 1 week
- Immediate reviewability for skipped characters
- Bulk introduction command for testing

**Testing:**
- ✅ Manual testing with database queries
- ✅ Verified unlock logic with multiple scenarios

## Bug Fix: Incomplete Characters Immediately Reviewable

**Date:** 2025-10-19
**Status:** ✅ Fixed

### Problem Description

When completing the post-introduction review by exiting early and leaving some characters unreviewed, those incomplete characters were not being placed in the review pool immediately as intended. Instead, they were being scheduled for review in 1 hour.

### Root Causes Identified

**Bug #1: Timing Race Condition**
- Location: `src-tauri/src/commands/mod.rs:93, 203`
- Issue: Setting `next_review_date = datetime('now')` created race condition
- SQLite's `datetime('now')` has sub-second precision
- Query `WHERE next_review_date <= datetime('now')` could fail if microseconds passed

**Bug #2: Duplicate Character Processing**
- Location: `src/App.tsx` (`handleInitialSrsComplete`)
- Issue: `SpacedRepetition.tsx` correctly marked incomplete characters, but then `App.tsx` would call `complete_initial_srs_session` with ALL character IDs
- This overwrote correct immediate scheduling with 1-hour interval

**Bug #3: Natural Session Completion**
- Location: `src/components/Study/SpacedRepetition.tsx`
- Issue: When session completed naturally (all questions answered), incomplete characters weren't processed at all
- Only early-exit path handled incomplete characters

### Solutions Implemented

**Fix #1: Eliminate Timing Race Condition**
```rust
// src-tauri/src/commands/mod.rs (lines 93, 203)
next_review_date = datetime('now', '-1 second')
```
Sets review date to 1 second in past, guaranteeing it passes the check.

**Fix #2: Unified Character Processing**
```typescript
// src/components/Study/SpacedRepetition.tsx (lines 332-379)
const processInitialStudyCompletion = async () => {
  // Separates characters into completed vs incomplete
  // Completed (not already submitted) → 1-hour interval
  // Incomplete → Immediately reviewable
}
```
Called from both natural completion and early exit.

**Fix #3: Remove Duplicate Processing**
```typescript
// src/App.tsx (lines 118-141)
// handleInitialSrsComplete() now only:
// 1. Updates unlock timer
// 2. Clears batch state
// 3. Returns to dashboard
// NO LONGER calls complete_initial_srs_session
```

**Files Modified:**
- `src-tauri/src/commands/mod.rs` (lines 93, 203)
- `src/components/Study/SpacedRepetition.tsx` (lines 332-379, 311, 400)
- `src/App.tsx` (lines 118-141)

**Verification:**
- ✅ Characters completed fully → Scheduled for 1 hour review
- ✅ Characters incomplete (partial answers) → Immediately reviewable
- ✅ Characters never answered → Immediately reviewable
- ✅ Works on natural session completion
- ✅ Works on early session exit

**Documentation:**
- Full bug analysis in `docs/currentTask.md`
